# Consistent-Dungeon-Siege-Art

The repository for my mod, Consistent Textures, which is a modification of Dungeon Siege in which seeks to synchronize the in-game art with the inventory art, which up 
until the publication of this mod, had many, many discrepencies between each other. Because Dungeon Siege takes textures in a unique .raw format, they become difficult 
to edit or view. While the publisher of this mod, myself, is fond of mod being open sourced, I am not a texture artist. Any texture provided was used with permission and
willingly submitted for this project. 

Tristanzz
Moros
Kathycf
Project Britannica
and Eksevis, myself,

have directly contributed at least something to this mod, or is otherwise registered under free distrubtion law by the creators. I believe it is our right as modders 
(especially that of an older game) to provide assets for inspiration for the future generation of modders or works to otherwise study, add onto and/or redistribute as 
they please so long as correct credits are given to the respective artist.

For further detail concerning who exactly did what, I have provided signatures in amr_consistent_texture_fix.gas, which if downloaded, can be read with Notepad or any
other similar program.

The packaged mod ready for use in your game can be downloaded at:

On top of the textures that are included within the compiled version, there is an additional texture that I believe was fairly well done, but otherwise did not match the
project I had in mind. With their permission I have decided to nevertheless include it on this repository. It is clearly labeled as "Unused" so as to create as little
confusion as possible.
